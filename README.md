# UAL
### That's not how you program
Unreasonable Automation Language, or UAL is a esoteric programming language mainly for mathematical needs. It is a very fun and easy-to-use language after you learn how it works. UAL is significantly similar to *Brainfuck*.

## What it can do
What can it do? UAL can do lots. You can make calculators, words, text, numbers, and all sorts of stuff. UAL works in 16 slots, each changeable at any time. No clicking, no dragging, just typing.

## To-Do

- [x] Write a fully working interpreter in Lua (5.1)
- [ ] Write a fully working interpreter in C
- [ ] Create a small documentation for the language
- [ ] Create extensive documentation for the language
- [ ] Possibly add more character commands
- [ ] Release several interpreters for UAL
- [x] Add more to the to-do list

## Examples
Here are some examples of UAL in action.

###### Addition
This program requires 2 inputs. The first is added to the second and put into the third slot.
```
.!>.>?<!>?;@
```

###### Subtraction
This program requires 2 inputs. The second is subtracted from the first and put into the third slot.
```
.!>.>$<!>$;@
```

###### "UAL" Text
This outputs "UAL" in an interpreter. This uses ascii code to calculate the letter equivalent.
```
>>>+^^+!<<<+^^+^^^^?!>?>>!<<$$$$<!>>?>!<$$+>!$;|@
```

## Want UAL?
We haven't released it yet. Be patient.
