# UAL
### That's not how you program
Unreasonable Automation Language, or UAL is a esoteric programming language mainly for mathematical needs. It is a very fun and easy-to-use language after you learn how it works. UAL is significantly similar to *Brainfuck*.

## What it can do
What can it do? UAL can do lots. You can make calculators, words, text, numbers, and all sorts of stuff. UAL works in 16 slots, each changeable at any time. No clicking, no dragging, just typing.

## Examples
Here are some examples of UAL in action.

###### Addition
This program requires 2 inputs. The first is added to the second and put into the third slot.
```
.!>.>?<!>?;@
```

###### Subtraction
This program requires 2 inputs. The second is subtracted from the first and put into the third slot.
```
.!>.>$<!>$;@
```

###### "UAL" Text
This outputs "UAL" in an interpreter. This uses ascii code to calculate the letter equivalent.
```
>>>+^^+!<<<+^^+^^^^?!>?>>!<<$$$$<!>>?>!<$$+>!$;|@
```
